PHP Personal Project (Goodmorning Health)
===========

* Author: Unha Back (Jayden)

This project is just for practicing how to use PHP for the web development. I created online shop, called Goodmorning Health, the customer can add the products into the cart and make order. If I tried to use the framework such as Laravel, the purpose of this project is only to understand php programming. So, it is quite messy as you can see the all code in the one root folder, but it's good for taking time to look around php code.

Environment
------------

* php7.1
* MY SQL
* web server (Apache)

Quick Start
-----------

Create `config.php` file. 
Then, input your HOST, USER_NAME, Password, Database name like below.

```
const DB_HOST = 'localhost';
const DB_USER = 'root';
const DB_PWD = '******';
const DB_NAME = 'gmhealh';
```
Run your web server, and it will be working!

Admin account info.
-------------
Actually, this is just for my private project. So, I can share the admin account info.
* admin@gmhealth.com
* p@ssw0rd

You can see the different navigation after you login as either members or admin.
